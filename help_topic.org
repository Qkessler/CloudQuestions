* CloudQuestions help questions.
** What is CloudQuestions?
   CloudQuestions is a personal project that I (Enrique Kessler Mart√≠nez(link?)) started with the objective of learning the Django framework.
   CloudQuestions is also my way of creating a better workflow at university, as it helps with the automation of my process.
   Finally, CloudQuestions is "Efficient learning made easy", as we combine FlashCards with spaced repetition, helping you reach your full potential.
   
** How do you add topics?
   You have to be logged in to be able to add topics.
   There are two ways of adding topics:
   - File uploading: Files supported are Markdown, which is a common format for text on the web. See below for the format required on questions.
   - Web functionality: Click the "Create topic" button on the questions page. It links to the "Create topic" view, where you can create topics easily.
     Every topic not saved with the "Save" button is discarded.
